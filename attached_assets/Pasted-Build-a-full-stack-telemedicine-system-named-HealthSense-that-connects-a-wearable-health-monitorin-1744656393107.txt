Build a full-stack telemedicine system named "HealthSense" that connects a wearable health monitoring device to a web application for real-time disease prediction using machine learning models. The device reads health data using sensors and sends it continuously or periodically to the backend server via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth or an API.

üß† Project Summary
Create a connected system where:

A portable IoT device (e.g., Raspberry Pi + sensors) captures live data like:

Glucose Level (CGM)

Blood Pressure (BPM sensor)

SpO‚ÇÇ and Heart Rate (Pulse Oximeter)

The device sends this data via HTTP (POST) requests to the web server

The backend processes this data using trained ML models for:

Diabetes

Heart Disease

Hypoxia

(Optional) Skin Cancer (via image input from camera or manual upload)

The predictions are shown on a web dashboard in real time.

üîß System Architecture
1. Wearable Device / Sensor Node
Built using Raspberry Pi or Arduino + ESP32

Reads sensor values from CGM, BP sensor, SpO‚ÇÇ sensor, ECG

Packs the readings into a JSON object

Sends data via HTTP or MQTT to the backend server every X seconds

2. Backend (Python Flask / FastAPI)
Receives data from the device using a POST API endpoint like /api/healthdata

Parses the incoming sensor data

Runs each data point through the appropriate pre-trained ML model

Stores the input and result in a MongoDB or SQLite database

Returns the disease risk prediction as JSON

3. Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS or React)
Dashboard displays:

Real-time health graphs

Current and historical predictions

Alert system if any risk exceeds threshold

Page also allows:

Optional manual override/input

Download of reports (PDF/CSV)

üß† ML Models To Integrate
Use pre-trained models from your project:

diabetes_model.pkl: Logistic Regression

heart_model.pkl: Random Forest

hypoxia_model.pkl: SVM

cancer_model.h5: CNN (used for uploaded skin images)

üóÉÔ∏è Database
Store:

Sensor data

Prediction results

Timestamps & device ID (for multi-user/multi-device support)

üì° Communication Protocol
Device sends data via:

HTTP POST to backend REST API, or

MQTT if you want lightweight, continuous publishing

Backend must be capable of handling and authenticating incoming device requests

üíª Tools/Stack to Use

‚úÖ Goals
Create a realistic simulation or actual working demo of a smart telemedicine device

Demonstrate how real-time data can be:

Captured

Transmitted

Analyzed by ML

Displayed on a health dashboard

üì¶ Optional Add-ons
Token-based authentication for device communication

Admin panel for patient data management

Email alerts for abnormal readings

üì• Bonus
